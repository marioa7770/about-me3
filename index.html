    <p style="color:orange">Hello my name is Mario Acevedo I was born and raised in San Francisco. I have an AAS in business administration and I also have a certificate for Sound Engineering.I hope to learn JS and get a better understanding of it and learn a lot. I have always believed that everything takes hard work and nothing comes easy. I would like to have a career in tech and make a better living for myself and the same time do something that I enjoy.</p>

    <p style="color:orange">I currently work in the Auto Collision repair industry. The work is stressful and what I like to call "High Octane".I have been in the business since 2012. Before that I worked in customer service and I have in AAS in Business Administration. I I got tired of working the same type of jobs  and wanted to do something different. At my last job my co-worker was attending a coding school and I would see him code I was curious and I asked him about it and that is how I got into wanting to code.</p>

    <p style="color:orange"> I became interested in coding right away and started looking up videos on youtube. I tried learning Ruby Language first but found it too difficult for a beginner. I was advised to start with JavaScript which I did. I often find myself going back to some ruby exercises and now I am able to understand them alot easier. I find code fasinating and look forward to the problem solving and working hard.
